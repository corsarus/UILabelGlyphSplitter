This is the sample project for the [Custom UILabel with glyph layout ](http://corsarus.com/2015/custom-glyph-layout-for-uilabel/) blog post.

The project is a demonstration of using Text Kit to split the content of a UILabel into individual glyphs and create CATextLayer instances for each glyph.


The code is written in Objective-C.
